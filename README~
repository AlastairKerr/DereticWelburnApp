A region is defined by the largest number of patterns in a window I
have look at the number of patterns in various sized windows, each can
be used as a filter.

I have also taken the patterns in a 300bp window, then taken a 50bp
flank from the 1st and last pattern position and calculated the number
of amino acids in this region that are predicted to be disordered by
iuphred. You can filter by the percentage of such amino acids now as
well.

From the reactome database I have extracted all genes that are linked
to mitotis. You can filter on these genes as well as their tissue
expression. If selected then values will be added to the table. 

I have kept the previous cluster groups but note that this is based on
whole protein numbers of patterns.  I could redo using just these regions.

Again note that any filtering applied on the left plane will be
applied to the table for download.  Filtering using the boxes and
arrows on the table itself will only change the view .


If any of this is unclear please come and see me
